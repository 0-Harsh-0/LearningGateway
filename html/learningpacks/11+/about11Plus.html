                    The 11+ exam is a test that is taken by students in England who want to get into a grammar school. It is an entrance
                    exam and failing this test could mean that they lose their potential place.
                    
                    While this exam is optional, it is a good way to broaden your childâ€™s academic options by giving them the chance to get
                    into a selective school for their education from year 7 onwards.
                    
                    The exam is only taken in England, as Scotland and Wales no longer have any grammar schools. The test is taken after a
                    child reaches the age of 11 years and when reach their last year of their primary education, i.e. year 6.
                    
                    The exams often take place in September and results are received in October. This allows parents to place their
                    applications for secondary schools in good time for the following academic year.
