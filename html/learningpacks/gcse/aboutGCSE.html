                <p class="inter">
                GCSE stands for the General Certificate of Secondary Education, and its purpose in education is to provide an academic
                qualification in a particular subject like Maths, English and Science.

                Students will start officially studying for GCSE exams in either Year 9 or 10, depending on the school they attend, and
                the subject studied. The exams will be taken at the end of Year 11.

                Students tend to take 5 GCSEs at Key Stage 4, enabling them to achieve qualifications in the core subjects English,
                Maths and Science, as well as two subjects of their choosing. Though, this varies depending on the school.

                Over the years there have been substantial changes to the GCSE concept. Now, more subjects are on offer, existing
                subjects have been altered, exam formats, regulations and the grading of GCSE exams have all altered considerably.

                GCSEs are typically studied by 14-16-year-olds, but you can complete a GCSE to get qualified in a subject of interest at
                any age.
